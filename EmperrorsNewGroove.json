				"You point at the writing and then move your hand as though holding a stylus or quill. As you intone the spell, the script appears on a sheet of paper close at hand.",
				"You cause writing from one source (such as a book) to be copied into a book, paper, or parchment. This spell copies 250 words per minute (about one page) and creates a perfect duplicate of the original. The spell copies only nonmagical text, not illustrations or magical writings (such as the text of a spellbook or a spell scroll). If the target contains normal and magical writing (such as a letter with a glyph of warding), only the normal text is copied, leaving blank space in the copied text where the magical writing would be expected. Likewise, if the target contains text and illustration, only the text is copied.",
				"The spell triggers (but does not copy) writing-based magic traps in the material being copied.",
				"Blank paper, parchment, or a book must be provided for the spell to write upon. If the target has multiple pages, the spell automatically turns to the next blank page whenever necessary. If more pages in the target exist than blank pages are available, the spell copies the original until it runs out of blank pages. At any time during the spell's duration you can redirect the magic to copy from another target, copy onto a different blank source, or resume a duplication that was interrupted by a shortfall of blank pages.",
				"The spell does not translate the copied writing. If you do not understand the original, you have no additional ability to understand the copy."
